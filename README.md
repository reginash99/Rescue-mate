# Recording

To record the incomming audio, we used MediaStream Recording API. Incorporating this API, it is possible to store real-time recorded audio.
Attention: It is necessary to give permisson to use the microphone of your device. It may happen that some browsers deny this per default. 

The icons are provided by bootstrap. While recording the audio, a video is shown representing that a recording is ongoing displaying the waves of a voice wave. But it doesn't represent the actual data. The clip is used from vecteezy.com.
