# Installation
# SE Mamba
For SE Mamba, a Linux-based system is required, but we are operating on Windows. 
In order to overcome the errors that follow the recommended installation process. 

WSL is required. 
Conda is required. 
Pytorch, Torchaudio and Cuda are required. 

After installation of conda on Ubuntu, create a conda environment and activate it. 

Then, when installing the requirements.txt packages, run conda install pysoundfile instead of soundfile, skip argparse, torch and torchaudio. 

Then run cd mamba_install.

Run pip install .
